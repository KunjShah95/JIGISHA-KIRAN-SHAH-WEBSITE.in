# Security Guidelines for Website

## Handling Personal Information

### WhatsApp Integration Security

1. **Minimal Data Transfer:** 
   - We've updated the WhatsApp integration to send minimal information in the initial message
   - No personal details are included in WhatsApp preview messages
   - This prevents personal data from being visible in notifications or chat previews

2. **Form Submission Security:**
   - Added CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery
   - Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
   - Form validation now occurs both client-side and before submission

3. **Data Privacy Measures:**
   - Personal data is not stored in client-side storage
   - Secure communication channels are prioritized
   - No personal information is logged to console

### Best Practices for Customer Data

   - Customer inquiries contain sensitive personal information
   - Do not share screenshots of conversations or inquiries on social media

2. **Manual response protocol:**
   - When receiving an inquiry, process it through your secure CRM
   - Never forward raw customer data via email or messaging apps
   - Use secure channels for discussing client information

3. **Document retention policy:**
