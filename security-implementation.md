# Data Security Implementation

This document explains how form data is securely transmitted from the website to Jigisha Shah's WhatsApp.

## Form Data Encryption

When a user submits the contact form on the website, the following security measures are in place:

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - The form data is encrypted using a multi-pass encryption approach:
     - First pass: XOR encryption with a dynamically generated key
     - Second pass: Character shifting for additional obfuscation
     - Final pass: Base64 encoding for safe transmission
   - A unique encryption key is generated for each form submission based on:
     - Current timestamp
     - Random string
     - A predefined salt

3. **Direct WhatsApp Integration**:
   - The encrypted data is sent directly to WhatsApp via the `wa.me` API
   - The data is never stored on any server
   - Only Jigisha Shah will receive the form details

4. **Privacy Measures**:
   - No cookies are used to track user behavior
   - No third-party analytics tools are embedded
   - User consent is explicitly required before form submission

## Security Recommendations

For production environments with highly sensitive data, consider the following enhancements:

1. Implement a more robust encryption library like CryptoJS
2. Use HTTPS for all communications
3. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Implement CAPTCHA for form submissions
